# Background and goals

ELP

Our internship team has 4 main goals:

1.  To gain familiarity with genomics/genetics literature and theory through the assigned readings

2.  To get practice with the lab skills necessary for extraction, PCR and sequencing (with the Oxford Nanopore MinION)

3.  To develop a working protocol to DNA metabarcode woolly fecal samples to detect insects (and plants?) in their diet

# Important Notes							 	

-   When conducting this protocol, always wear a suitable lab coat, disposable acrylamide gloves and protective goggles/glasses. For more information, consult the appropriate safety data sheets (SDSs) available from the product supplier.

-   To ensure proper sample identification, label sides and tops of the tubes. Processes used in this protocol may rub the labels off of the tubes, so it\'s important to duplicate!

-   Always include a control sample of sterile/DNAse free water for every extraction so that you can detect potential contamination!

-   Perform all centrifugation steps at room temperature (15--25°C).

-   If **Solution C1** has precipitated, heat at 60°C until the precipitate dissolves. 

-   Shake to mix **Solution C4** before use.

# Protocol (last updated 18FEB24 by CAS)				

### Required Equipment and Reagents

-   In this protocol, equipment available in the **DNeasy PowerLyzer PowerSoil Kit** will be marked in **blue**. Equipment available in the SMAGL will be in **black**.

-   Biosafety cabinet (BSC) - remember to prepare it before getting started! \[**BSC**\]. Unless otherwise specified, all steps of this protocol should be performed in the BSC.

-   Microcentrifuge set to 10,000 rcf (not rpm) \[**Centrifuge Workstation**\]

-   Pipettes and pipette tips (sterile filter tips), prepare ahead to make sure you don\'t run out! \[Use filter tips; available on shelving above **PCR** and **Quantitation Workstations**; you should ONLY use the pipettes in the **BSC** and/or **Extraction Workstation** for extractions. The **Quantitation Station** has its own set of pipettes.\]

-   Heat block or water bath set at 65C (this takes time to heat up; get it ready before starting the protocol) \[**Extraction Workstation**\]

-   Vortexer \[**Extraction Workstation** or **BSC**\]

-   Bead-beater (we use an alternative to the PowerLyzer homogenizer) \[**BSC**\]

Prior to starting, UV all tubes, pipettes, tips, etc. in the PCR or BSC for 10 minutes

-   1\. Add 0.25 g of fecal matter to the **PowerBead Tubes**.

-   2\. Add 750 𝜇l of **PowerBead Solution** to the **PowerBead Tubes**.

-   3\. Add 60 𝜇l of **Solution C1** to tubes and vortex briefly. If **Solution C1** has precipitated, heat to 60ºC until precipitate has dissolved (in heat block or water bath). 

    -   **Note**: Vortexing mixes the components in the **PowerBead Tube** and begins to disperse the sample.

-   4\. Incubate **PowerBead Tubes** at 65ºC for **30 min** in **heat block** or **water bath.**

    -   This may be done by adding the **Extraction Workstation** dry block to the **BSC**; if you choose to do this, please clean it and add it to the BSC while preparing the BSC prior to beginning the protocol\]. 

-   5\. Secure tubes in the **Bead Beater \[BSC\]** and run for 5 minutes at 2000 RPM, pause for 30 seconds, and run again for 5 minutes at 2000 RPM. You may run these in evenly divided batches to initiate the subsequent centrifuge step with balanced samples.

-   6\. **Centrifuge** tubes at 10,000 g (rcf) for 30 s. Make sure the **PowerBead Tubes** rotate freely in the centrifuge without rubbing. 

    -   If 30 s is not long enough to pellet the sample, you may run for 3 min at the same speed.

-   7\. Transfer supernatant (\~400-500 𝜇l) to clean **2 ml Collection Tube** (you may still have chunks of poo at this point in the supernatant).

-   8\. Add 250 𝜇l of **Solution C2** to tubes and vortex for 5 s. Incubate at 4ºC for 10 min. 

    -   **Note**: **Solution C2** has Inhibitor Removal Technology (IRT). It contains a reagent that can precipitate non-DNA organic and inorganic material, including humic substances, cell debris and proteins. It is important to remove contaminating organic and inorganic matter that may reduce DNA purity and inhibit downstream DNA applications.

-   9\. **Centrifuge** the tubes at 10,000 g (rcf) for 1 min.

-   10\. Transfer up to 600 𝜇l of supernatant to a clean **2 ml Collection Tube** (make sure to only transfer the liquid -- none of the pellet here!). 

    -   **Note**: The pellet at this point contains non-DNA organic and inorganic material, including humic acid, cell debris and proteins. For best DNA yields and quality, avoid transferring any of the pellet.

-   11\. Add 200 𝜇l of **Solution C3** to the tubes and **vortex** briefly. Incubate at 4ºC for 10 min (use the old mini-fridge for this step, below the **PCR Workstation**). 

    -   **Note**: **Solution C3** has Inhibitor Removal Technology (IRT) and is a second reagent to precipitate additional non-DNA organic and inorganic material including humic acid, cell debris and proteins. It is important to remove contaminating organic and inorganic matter that may reduce DNA purity and inhibit downstream DNA applications.

-   12\. **Centrifuge** the tubes at 10,000 g (rcf) for 1 min.

-   13\. Transfer up to 750 𝜇l of supernatant to a clean **2 ml Collection Tube**. Once again, be careful to avoid the pellet!

    -   **Note**: The pellet at this point contains non-DNA organic and inorganic material including humic acid, cell debris and proteins. For best DNA yields and quality, avoid transferring any of the pellet. 	

-   14\. Add 1.2 ml of **Solution C4** to the supernatant and **vortex** for 5 s. Shake **Solution C4** by hand to mix prior to adding. Also, this will fill the **Collection Tube** to the brim, so be prepared.

    -   **Note: This contains guanidine salts, which is highly reactive. Do not mix or clean with bleach!!!**

    -   **Note**: Solution C4 is a high-concentration salt solution. Since DNA binds tightly to silica at high salt concentrations, this will adjust the DNA solution salt concentrations to allow binding of DNA, but not non-DNA organic and inorganic material that may still be present at low levels, to the **Spin Filter**.

-   15a. First wash: Pipette 675 𝜇l of the supernatant to a **Spin Filter** and centrifuge at 10,000 g (rcf) for 1 min. Discard the liquid flow through. Repeat until all supernatant has passed through the column. (This will take 3x washes through the column).

    -   **Note**: DNA is selectively bound to the silica membrane in the MB Spin Column device in the high salt solution. Contaminants pass through the filter membrane, leaving only DNA bound to the membrane. 

-   15b. Second Wash: Pipette 675 𝜇l of the supernatant to the same **Spin Filter** and centrifuge at 10,000 g (rcf) for 1 min. Discard the liquid flow through.

-   15c. Third Wash: Pipette 675 𝜇l of the supernatant to the same **Spin Filter** and centrifuge at 10,000 g (rcf) for 1 min. Discard the liquid flow through.

-   16\. Add 500 𝜇l of **Solution C5** to the filter and centrifuge at 10,000 g (rcf) for 30 s. Discard the liquid flow through.

    -   **Note**: **Solution C5** is an ethanol-based wash solution used to further clean the DNA that is bound to the silica filter membrane in the **Spin Filter**. This wash solution removes residual salt, humic acid, and other contaminants while allowing the DNA to stay bound to the silica membrane. 

-   17\. Centrifuge the **Spin Filter** column a second time at 10,000 g (rcf) for 1 min.

    -   **Note**: This flow-through fraction is non-DNA organic and inorganic waste removed from the silica **Spin Filter** membrane by the ethanol wash solution. The second spin removes residual **Solution C5** (ethanol wash solution). It is critical to remove all traces of wash solution because the ethanol in **Solution C5** can interfere with many downstream DNA applications, such as PCR and gel electrophoresis.

-   18\. Place **Spin Filter** into a clean and labeled **2 ml Collection Tube** (this is the tube going into the freezer, so make sure it\'s labeled appropriately). Avoid splashing any **Solution C5** onto the **Spin Filter**.

-   19\. Incubate **Solution C6** for 5 minutes at 65ºC. Then, add 100 𝜇l of **Solution C6** to the center of the filter membrane.

    -   **Note**: Placing **Solution C6** in the center of the small white membrane will make sure the entire membrane is wet. This will result in a more efficient and complete release of the DNA from the **Spin Filter** membrane. As **Solution C6** passes through the silica membrane, DNA that was bound in the presence of high salt is selectively released by **Solution C6** (which is actually 10 mM Tris), which lacks salt.	

-   20\. Incubate samples at room temperature for 25 minutes. Then **centrifuge** at 10,000 g (rcf) for 30 sec, and finally discard the spin filter.

-   Your DNA is ready for use!

-   22\. Measure the dsDNA concentration using the **Quantus**, and sample A260/A280 using the **NanoDrop** \[**Quantitation Workstation**\]. Record these details in your lab notebook.

-   Place the properly labeled DNA elutions in the -20ºC freezer. Be sure to record where in the freezer you\'ve placed them, and that they are all together in a single, clearly labeled container/rack.

# Extraction Protocol (**QIAGEN Stool Kit)**

This protocol is modified from the protocol developed by Mel Zarate in the SMAGL lab following modifications based on published protocols by Tony Di Fiore (University of Texas at Austin)

## General notes before starting

-   Ensure that you are wearing suitable PPE: a lab coat, protective eye glasses and gloves (you can consult the appropriate safety data sheets from product suppliers if you have any doubts)

-   Turn on the biosafety cabinet (BSC) and let it run for a minimum of 15 minutes before starting the protocol

-   Turn on the water bath and set it to 70 °C

-   Turn on the heat block and set it to 56 °C

-   Make up a new batch of 10% bleach solution (1 part bleach to 9 parts distilled water) for the day and dispose of any from previous days. Be sure to appropriately label the vessel with date and contents!

-   Aliquot sufficient 96-100% **ethanol** (available in the **Flammables Cabinet**) to a smaller vessel for use later in the protocol. Be sure to appropriately label the vessel with date and contents!

-   Clean all pipettes and work surfaces (including inside the biosafety cabinet) first with the bleach solution, then distilled water, and finally with 70% ethanol

-   Ensure that you have sufficient supplies (i.e., autoclaved, sterile tubes, pipette tips, etc.) before beginning

-   UV all tubes, pipettes and pipette tips in either the BSC or the PCR hood for 10 minutes before starting (be careful to limit your exposure to the UV light!)

-   Removed samples to be extracted from the freezer and let them thaw on ice

## Notes on the protocol

-   Make sure to label all tubes on both the top and sides (it is easy for labels to get rubbed off during the protocol)

-   Always include a control sample of sterile/DNAse free water for every extraction so that you can detect potential contamination!

-   Perform all centrifugation steps at room temperature (15--25 °C)

-   The 2 ml tubes used in step 4 should be wide enough to accommodate an InhibitEX Tablet. If it's not wide enough, you may need to break up the tablet to insert

## Required equipment and supplies

-   In this protocol, equipment/reagents available in the QIAGEN stool Kit will be marked in [blue]{style="color:blue"}. Equipment and supplies available in the SMAGL will be in [green]{style="color:green"}.
-   You will use the following pieces of equipment: a [biosafety cabinet]{style="color:green"}, [fridge]{style="color:green"} (located below the **PCR workstation**), [pipettes]{style="color:green"} (the extraction set are located inside the **BSC** or at the **extraction workstation**), [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} (you will need to use the largest centrifuge at the **Centrifuge Station** as this is the only one that goes this fast) set to 20,000 rcf (not rpm), a [benchtop microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} (located at the **quantification workstation**), a [heating block]{style="color:green"} set to 56 °C, a [waterbath]{style="color:green"} set to 70 °C (located at the **extraction workstation**), a [vortexer]{style="color:green"} (located at the **extraction workstation** or inside **BSC**), a [tube rocker]{style="color:green"} (located at the **extraction workstation**), and a [bead-beater]{style="color:green"} (located in the **BSC**)
-   You will need [pipette tips]{style="color:green"} (located on shelves above the **PCR** or **quantification workstations**). ONLY use filter tips!
-   You will need [2 mL]{style="color:green"} and [1.5 mL tubes]{style="color:green"} which must be **autoclaved** prior to use! You'll have to count ahead in the protocol based on how many samples you're running and how many tubes you'll need to figure out the amount so that you'll be prepared
-   You will also need [96-100 % ethanol]{style="color:green"}

## Protocol

1.  Label the same number of [2ml tubes]{style="color:green"} as samples, plus one for a control

2.  Vortex the fecal sample for a few seconds

3.  Pipet 200 𝜇l of fecal slurry into the tube (you will need to cut the tips off each pipette tip with a razor blade to make the point wide enough to be able to suck up the sample)

4.  Add 1.6 ml of [Buffer ASL]{style="color:blue"} to each tube (if the solution has precipitated, dissolve by incubating at 70 °C in the [waterbath]{style="color:green"})

5.  Vortex each tube for 1 minute or until the sample is thoroughly homogenized (It is very important to vortex the samples thoroughly. This helps ensure maximum DNA concentration in the final eluate)

6.  Incubate samples at 56 ºC in the [heating block]{style="color:green"} for 30-60 min

7.  Incubate samples at room temperature in the tube rocker for 30 minutes

8.  An **optional** step is to further incubate the samples in the [heating block]{style="color:green"} at 23 ºC **overnight. THIS IS A POTENTIAL STOPPING POINT**

9.  Increase the temperature of the [heating block]{style="color:green"} to 70 ºC

10. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute to pellet stool particles (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

11. Label a new set of [2 ml tubes]{style="color:green"}

12. Pipet 1.4 ml of the supernatant into the new [2 ml tubes]{style="color:green"} and discard the pellet

13. Add 1 [InhibitEX Tablet]{style="color:blue"} or 500 𝜇l of [liquid InhibitEX]{style="color:blue"} (newer kits have liquid, older have tablets) to each sample

14. Vortex each sample immediately for 1 minute or until the [InhibitEX]{style="color:blue"} is completely suspended

15. Incubate suspension for 1 min at room temperature to allow inhibitors to adsorb to the [InhibitEX]{style="color:blue"} matrix

16. Label a new set of [1.5 ml tubes]{style="color:green"}

17. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 3 minutes to pellet stool particles and inhibitors bound to the [InhibitEX]{style="color:blue"} matrix (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

    -   **Note**: for difficult samples centrifugation for 3 minutes may result in a pellet that is not sufficiently compact. Therefore it may be difficult to remove enough supernatant to transfer 600 𝜇l supernatant after the next centrifugation step. In these cases, we recommend to centrifuge for 6 minutes
    -   **Note**: When processing more than 12 samples, for this step and step 17 we recommend processing batches of no more than 12 samples each. This is because the pellets formed after centrifugation will break up quickly if the supernatant is not removed immediately

18. Immediately after the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} stops, pipet all of the supernatant into the clean [1.5 ml tubes]{style="color:green"} and discard the pellet (Transferring small quantities of pelleted material from the previous step will not affect the procedure)

19. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 3 minutes (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

20. Label a new set of [2 ml tubes]{style="color:green"}

21. Pipet 25 𝜇l of [proteinase K]{style="color:blue"} into the newly labeled tubes

22. Pipet 600 𝜇l supernatant from step 18 into the tubes containing the [proteinase K]{style="color:blue"}

23. Add 600 𝜇l [Buffer AL]{style="color:blue"}

    -   **Note**: do **NOT** add [proteinase K]{style="color:blue"} directly to [Buffer AL]{style="color:blue"}. It is essential that the sample and [Buffer AL]{style="color:blue"} are thoroughly mixed to form a homogeneous solution

24. Vortex tubes for 15 seconds

25. Incubate the tubes in the [heating block]{style="color:green"} at 70°C for 60 min

    -   You may want to briefly centrifuge the tubes using the small [benchtop centrifuge]{style="color:green"} at the **Quantification Station** to remove drops from the inside of the tube lid (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

26. Add 600 𝜇l of [96--100 % ethanol]{style="color:green"} to the lysate

27. Vortex briefly

    -   You may want to briefly centrifuge the tubes using the small [benchtop centrifuge]{style="color:green"} at the **Quantification Station** to remove drops from the inside of the tube lid (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

28. Label the lid of a new set of [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} and [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

29. Carefully apply 600 𝜇l of the lysate to the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} without moistening the rim and close the cap

30. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

31. Label a new set of [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

32. Place the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of labeled [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the tubes containing the filtrate

    -   **Note**: if the lysate has not completely passed through the column after centrifugation, centrifuge again until the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"} is empty

33. Carefully open the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"}, apply a second aliquot of 600 𝜇l lysate and close the cap

34. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

35. Label the lid of a new set of [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

36. Place the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of labeled [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the tubes containing the filtrate

    -   **Note**: if the lysate has not completely passed through the column after centrifugation, centrifuge again until the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"} is empty

37. Carefully open the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"}, apply a third aliquot of 600 𝜇l lysate and close the cap

38. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

39. Label the lid of a new set of [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

40. Place the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of labeled [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the tubes containing the filtrate

    -   **Note**: if the lysate has not completely passed through the column after centrifugation, centrifuge again until the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"} is empty

41. Carefully open the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"} and add 500 𝜇l of [Buffer AW1]{style="color:blue"} and close the cap

42. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

43. Label the lid of a new set of [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

44. Place the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of labeled [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the tubes containing the filtrate

45. Carefully open the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"} and add 500 𝜇l of [Buffer AW2]{style="color:blue"} and close the cap

46. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 3 minutes (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

    -   **Note**: residual [Buffer AW2]{style="color:blue"} in the eluate may cause problems in downstream applications. Some centrifuge rotors may vibrate upon deceleration, resulting in the flow-through, which contains [Buffer AW2]{style="color:blue"}, contacting the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"}. Removing the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"} and [collection tube]{style="color:blue"} from the rotor may also cause flow-through to come into contact with the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"}

47. Label the lid of a new set of [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

48. Place the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of labeled [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the tubes containing the filtrate

49. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

    -   **Note**: this step is optional but recommended help eliminate the chance of [Buffer AW2]{style="color:blue"} carryover

50. Label the lid of a new set of [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

51. Place the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of labeled [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the tubes containing the filtrate (the filtrate should be minimal)

52. Place [Buffer AE]{style="color:blue"} in the waterbath at 70 ºC to incubate for 10 minutes

53. Label a new set of [1.5 ml tubes]{style="color:green"} (These are the tubes going into the freezer, so labeling is extra important!)

54. Transfer the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of [1.5 ml tubes]{style="color:green"}

55.  Carefully open the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"}, pipet 100 𝜇l of [Buffer AE]{style="color:blue"} directly onto the QIAamp membrane (do not touch the membrane with the pipette tip), and close the cap

56. Incubate the tubes at room temperature for 25 minutes

57. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute to elute the DNA (you will need to use the largest centrifuge at the **Centrifuge Station** as this is the only one that goes this fast)

58. Pull the filter portion of the tube up and cap the tube (you can either discard it or save them if you want to try and get more DNA out of them)

59. The liquid in the tube contains the DNA from the samples and should be stored in the [-20 °C freezer]{style="color:green"} when not in use! (Be sure to record where in the freezer you've placed them, and make sure that they are all together in a single, clearly labeled container/rack)

60. The next step is to quantify the DNA in the samples (this is done by measuring the dsDNA concentration using the [Quantus]{style="color:green"} and the sample A260/A280 using the [Nanodrop]{style="color:green"}, both are located at the **Extraction Workstation**). The results should be recorded in your lab notebook

    -   **Note**: DNA yield is typically 15--60 𝜇g but, depending on the individual stool sample and the way it was stored, may range from 5 to 100 𝜇g. DNA concentration is typically 75--300 ng/𝜇l

# Feb 26 - Mar 3

February 29, 2024:

1. Pipet 200 𝜇l of fecal slurry into the microcentrifuge tube. You may need to cut the end of the pipet tip with a razor blade, if necessary, to make pipetting easier. Remember to vortex the sample prior to pipetting, to make sure you are getting a good mixture of buffer and feces.


2. Add 1.6 ml Buffer ASL to each stool sample. Vortex continuously for 1 min or until the stool sample is thoroughly homogenized. 
Note: It is very important to vortex the samples thoroughly. This helps ensure maximum DNA concentration in the final eluate. 


3. Incubate samples at 56ºC in the Dry Bath for 30-60 min, then for an additional 30 min on Tube Rocker. 
Incubate at 56ºC in Dry Bath for 30-60 min

[We're doing 60 minutes JRE]

Incubate on the Tube Rocker for 30 min
Optional: further incubate in the Dry Bath at 23ºC degrees overnight.
