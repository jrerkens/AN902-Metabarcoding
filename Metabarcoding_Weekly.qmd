# Brief Github protocol

-   Install Git

-   Import in project via version control

-   You will have a project and all the files on Github will be pulled locally

-   Generate a personal access token on Github

-   Make your changes

-   Commit your changes (and write what you did in the commit box)

-   Stage the files you want to push up (this is just checking a box)

    -   If you need to pull anything, pull it (you'll be prompted)

-   If there are any hiccups, follow the instructions in the R terminal

-   Push!

-   Make sure to pull before you get started in the future!
