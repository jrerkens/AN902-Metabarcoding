-   Make your changes

-   Commit your changes (and write what you did in the commit box)

-   Stage the files you want to push up (this is just checking a box)

    -   If you need to pull anything, pull it (you'll be prompted)

-   If there are any hiccups, follow the instructions in the R terminal (git merge --abort is your best friend!)

-   Push!

# Background and goals

ELP

Our internship team has 4 main goals:

1.  To gain familiarity with genomics/genetics literature and theory through the assigned readings

2.  To get practice with the lab skills necessary for extraction, PCR and sequencing (with the Oxford Nanopore MinION)

3.  To develop a working protocol to DNA metabarcode woolly fecal samples to detect insects (and plants?) in their diet

4.  To practice bioinformatics skills by identifying and comparing the species eaten by YTWMs and common woolly monkeys

ELP

# Extraction Protocol (**QIAGEN Stool Kit)**

This protocol is modified from the protocol developed by Mel Zarate in the SMAGL lab following modifications based on published protocols by Tony Di Fiore (University of Texas at Austin)

## General notes before starting

-   Ensure that you are wearing suitable PPE: a lab coat, protective eye glasses and gloves (you can consult the appropriate safety data sheets from product suppliers if you have any doubts)

-   Turn on the biosafety cabinet (BSC) and let it run for a minimum of 15 minutes before starting the protocol

-   Turn on the water bath and set it to 70 ¬∞C

-   Turn on the heat block and set it to 56 ¬∞C

-   Make up a new batch of 10% bleach solution (1 part bleach to 9 parts distilled water) for the day and dispose of any from previous days. Be sure to appropriately label the vessel with date and contents!

-   Aliquot sufficient 96-100% **ethanol** (available in the **Flammables Cabinet**) to a smaller vessel for use later in the protocol. Be sure to appropriately label the vessel with date and contents!

-   Clean all pipettes and work surfaces (including inside the biosafety cabinet) first with the bleach solution, then distilled water, and finally with 70% ethanol

-   Ensure that you have sufficient supplies (i.e., autoclaved, sterile tubes, pipette tips, etc.) before beginning

-   UV all tubes, pipettes and pipette tips in either the BSC or the PCR hood for 10 minutes before starting (be careful to limit your exposure to the UV light!)

-   Removed samples to be extracted from the freezer and let them thaw on ice

## Notes on the protocol

-   Make sure to label all tubes on both the top and sides (it is easy for labels to get rubbed off during the protocol)

-   Always include a control sample of sterile/DNAse free water for every extraction so that you can detect potential contamination!

-   Perform all centrifugation steps at room temperature (15--25 ¬∞C)

-   The 2 ml tubes used in step 4 should be wide enough to accommodate an InhibitEX Tablet. If it's not wide enough, you may need to break up the tablet to insert

## Required equipment and supplies

-   In this protocol, equipment/reagents available in the QIAGEN stool Kit will be marked in [blue]{style="color:blue"}. Equipment and supplies available in the SMAGL will be in [green]{style="color:green"}.
-   You will use the following pieces of equipment: a [biosafety cabinet]{style="color:green"}, [fridge]{style="color:green"} (located below the **PCR workstation**), [pipettes]{style="color:green"} (the extraction set are located inside the **BSC** or at the **extraction workstation**), [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} (you will need to use the largest centrifuge at the **Centrifuge Station** as this is the only one that goes this fast) set to 20,000 rcf (not rpm), a [benchtop microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} (located at the **quantification workstation**), a [heating block]{style="color:green"} set to 56 ¬∞C, a [waterbath]{style="color:green"} set to 70 ¬∞C (located at the **extraction workstation**), a [vortexer]{style="color:green"} (located at the **extraction workstation** or inside **BSC**), a [tube rocker]{style="color:green"} (located at the **extraction workstation**), and a [bead-beater]{style="color:green"} (located in the **BSC**)
-   You will need [pipette tips]{style="color:green"} (located on shelves above the **PCR** or **quantification workstations**). ONLY use filter tips!
-   You will need [2 mL]{style="color:green"} and [1.5 mL tubes]{style="color:green"} which must be **autoclaved** prior to use! You'll have to count ahead in the protocol based on how many samples you're running and how many tubes you'll need to figure out the amount so that you'll be prepared
-   You will also need [96-100 % ethanol]{style="color:green"}

## Protocol

1.  Label the same number of [2ml tubes]{style="color:green"} as samples, plus one for a control

2.  Vortex the fecal sample for a few seconds

3.  Pipet 200 ùúál of fecal slurry into the tube (you will need to cut the tips off each pipette tip with a razor blade to make the point wide enough to be able to suck up the sample)

4.  Add 1.6 ml of [Buffer ASL]{style="color:blue"} to each tube (if the solution has precipitated, dissolve by incubating at 70 ¬∞C in the [waterbath]{style="color:green"})

5.  Vortex each tube for 1 minute or until the sample is thoroughly homogenized (It is very important to vortex the samples thoroughly. This helps ensure maximum DNA concentration in the final eluate)

6.  Incubate samples at 56 ¬∫C in the [heating block]{style="color:green"} for 30-60 min

7.  Incubate samples at room temperature in the tube rocker for 30 minutes

8.  An **optional** step is to further incubate the samples in the [heating block]{style="color:green"} at 23 ¬∫C **overnight. THIS IS A POTENTIAL STOPPING POINT**

9.  Increase the temperature of the [heating block]{style="color:green"} to 70 ¬∫C

10. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute to pellet stool particles (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

11. Label a new set of [2 ml tubes]{style="color:green"}

12. Pipet 1.4 ml of the supernatant into the new [2 ml tubes]{style="color:green"} and discard the pellet

13. Add 1 [InhibitEX Tablet]{style="color:blue"} or 500 ùúál of [liquid InhibitEX]{style="color:blue"} (newer kits have liquid, older have tablets) to each sample

14. Vortex each sample immediately for 1 minute or until the [InhibitEX]{style="color:blue"} is completely suspended

15. Incubate suspension for 1 min at room temperature to allow inhibitors to adsorb to the [InhibitEX]{style="color:blue"} matrix

16. Label a new set of [2 ml tubes]{style="color:green"}

17. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 3 minutes to pellet stool particles and inhibitors bound to the [InhibitEX]{style="color:blue"} matrix (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

    -   **Note**: for difficult samples centrifugation for 3 minutes may result in a pellet that is not sufficiently compact. Therefore it may be difficult to remove enough supernatant to transfer 600 ùúál supernatant after the next centrifugation step. In these cases, we recommend to centrifuge for 6 minutes
    -   **Note**: When processing more than 12 samples, for this step and step 17 we recommend processing batches of no more than 12 samples each. This is because the pellets formed after centrifugation will break up quickly if the supernatant is not removed immediately

18. Immediately after the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} stops, pipet all of the supernatant into the clean [2 ml tubes]{style="color:green"} and discard the pellet (Transferring small quantities of pelleted material from the previous step will not affect the procedure)

19. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 3 minutes (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

20. Label a new set of [2 ml tubes]{style="color:green"}

21. Pipet 25 ùúál of [proteinase K]{style="color:blue"} into the newly labeled tubes

22. Pipet 600 ùúál supernatant from step 18 into the tubes containing the [proteinase K]{style="color:blue"}

23. Add 600 ùúál [Buffer AL]{style="color:blue"}

    -   **Note**: do **NOT** add [proteinase K]{style="color:blue"} directly to [Buffer AL]{style="color:blue"}. It is essential that the sample and [Buffer AL]{style="color:blue"} are thoroughly mixed to form a homogeneous solution

24. Vortex tubes for 15 seconds

25. Incubate the tubes in the [heating block]{style="color:green"} at 70¬∞C for 60 min

    -   You may want to briefly centrifuge the tubes using the small [benchtop centrifuge]{style="color:green"} at the **Quantification Station** to remove drops from the inside of the tube lid (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

26. Add 600 ùúál of [96--100 % ethanol]{style="color:green"} to the lysate

27. Vortex briefly

    -   You may want to briefly centrifuge the tubes using the small [benchtop centrifuge]{style="color:green"} at the **Quantification Station** to remove drops from the inside of the tube lid (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

28. Label the lid of a new set of [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} and [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

29. Carefully apply 600 ùúál of the lysate to the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} without moistening the rim and close the cap

30. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

31. Carefully pull the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} out of the [collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the filtrate

    -   **Note**: if the lysate has not completely passed through the column after centrifugation, centrifuge again until the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} are empty

32. Replace the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} back into the now empty [collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

33. Carefully open the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"}, apply a second aliquot of 600 ùúál lysate and close the cap

34. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

35. Carefully pull the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} out of the [collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the filtrate

    -   **Note**: if the lysate has not completely passed through the column after centrifugation, centrifuge again until the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"} is empty

36. Replace the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} back into the now empty [collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

37. Carefully open the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"}, apply a third aliquot of 600 ùúál lysate and close the cap

38. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

39. Label the lid of a new set of [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

40. Place the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of labeled [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the tubes containing the filtrate

    -   **Note**: if the lysate has not completely passed through the column after centrifugation, centrifuge again until the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"} is empty

41. Carefully open the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"} and add 500 ùúál of [Buffer AW1]{style="color:blue"} and close the cap

42. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

43. Label the lid of a new set of [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

44. Place the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of labeled [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the tubes containing the filtrate

45. Carefully open the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"} and add 500 ùúál of [Buffer AW2]{style="color:blue"} and close the cap

46. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 3 minutes (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

    -   **Note**: residual [Buffer AW2]{style="color:blue"} in the eluate may cause problems in downstream applications. Some centrifuge rotors may vibrate upon deceleration, resulting in the flow-through, which contains [Buffer AW2]{style="color:blue"}, contacting the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"}. Removing the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"} and [collection tube]{style="color:blue"} from the rotor may also cause flow-through to come into contact with the [QIAamp spin column]{style="color:blue"}

47. Label the lid of a new set of [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

48. Place the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of labeled [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the tubes containing the filtrate

49. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute (make sure that the centrifuge is **balanced**)

    -   **Note**: this step is optional but recommended help eliminate the chance of [Buffer AW2]{style="color:blue"} carryover

50. Label the lid of a new set of [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"}

51. Place the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of labeled [2 ml collection tubes]{style="color:blue"} and discard the tubes containing the filtrate (the filtrate should be minimal)

52. Place [Buffer AE]{style="color:blue"} in the waterbath at 70 ¬∫C to incubate for 10 minutes

53. Label a new set of [2 ml tubes]{style="color:green"} (These are the tubes going into the freezer, so labeling is extra important!)

54. Transfer the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"} into the new set of [2 ml tubes]{style="color:green"}

55. Carefully open the [QIAamp spin columns]{style="color:blue"}, pipet 100 ùúál of [Buffer AE]{style="color:blue"} directly onto the QIAamp membrane (do not touch the membrane with the pipette tip), and close the cap

56. Incubate the tubes at room temperature for 25 minutes

57. Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute to elute the DNA (you will need to use the largest centrifuge at the **Centrifuge Station** as this is the only one that goes this fast)

58. Pull the filter portion of the tube up and cap the tube (you can either discard it or save them if you want to try and get more DNA out of them)

59. The liquid in the tube contains the DNA from the samples and should be stored in the [-20 ¬∞C freezer]{style="color:green"} when not in use! (Be sure to record where in the freezer you've placed them, and make sure that they are all together in a single, clearly labeled container/rack)

60. The next step is to quantify the DNA in the samples (this is done by measuring the dsDNA concentration using the [Quantus]{style="color:green"} and the sample A260/A280 using the [Nanodrop]{style="color:green"}, both are located at the **Extraction Workstation**). The results should be recorded in your lab notebook

    -   **Note**: DNA yield is typically 15--60 ùúág but, depending on the individual stool sample and the way it was stored, may range from 5 to 100 ùúág. DNA concentration is typically 75--300 ng/ùúál

# Quantus Quantitation Protocol

Manufacturer's protocol, without modifications from Melissa Zarate.

## Important Notes

-   Warm all assay components to room temperature before use.

-   You may need to prepare 1X TE buffer from more concentrated stock, although 1X TE Buffer is also available in the cabinets above the Centrifuge Workstation, and may already be pre-prepared in the Underbench Fridge.

-   If you have very little sample available, you may run this protocol using 1 Œºl rather than 2 Œºl.

-   Before running a tube in the Quantus, remember to wipe the tube down with Kimwipes to make sure the tube is clear.

## Required Equipment

-   QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA System (Cat.# E2670) \[**Underbench Fridge - PCR Workstation**\], elements available in this kit will be noted in **bold blue**, elements that are available in the lab will be noted in **bold black**.

-   QuantusTM Fluorometer (Cat.# E6150) \[**Quantitation Workstation**\]

-   Vortex¬†

-   Microcentrifuge¬†

-   Thin-walled 0.5ml PCR tubes (Cat.# E4941 or Axygen Cat.# PCR-05-C). Make sure enough are available prior to beginning! You may need to autoclave a new set - these are available above the autoclave \[**Autoclave Workstation**\].

-   Nuclease-free water \[Cabinet above water station\]

-   Pre-label your tubes to speed things up!

# Primer Selection

We will be using two sets of primers to identify insect species in the samples, and one set of primers to identify the plant species. All sets of primers have been successfully used by Dr. Mallott with various New World monkey species.

    -   ELP started at 4:15

-   Centrifuge the tubes in the [microcentrifuge]{style="color:green"} at 20,000 rcf (not rpm) for 1 minute to elute the DNA (you will need to use the largest centrifuge at the **Centrifuge Station** as this is the only one that goes this fast)

    -   ELP and JRE completed at 4:48.

<!-- -->

-   Pull the filter portion of the tube up and cap the tube (you can either discard it or save them if you want to try and get more DNA out of them)

    -   ELP completed at 4:56.

-   The liquid in the tube contains the DNA from the samples and should be stored in the [-20 ¬∞C freezer]{style="color:green"} when not in use! (Be sure to record where in the freezer you've placed them, and make sure that they are all together in a single, clearly labeled container/rack)

-   The next step is to quantify the DNA in the samples (this is done by measuring the dsDNA concentration using the [Quantus]{style="color:green"} and the sample A260/A280 using the [Nanodrop]{style="color:green"}, both are located at the **Extraction Workstation**). The results should be recorded in your lab notebook

    -   JRE labeled 0.5ml tubes and began UV'ing 10micro and 200 micro l pipette tips and pipettes at 4:50.

        1\. If necessary, prepare **1X TE Buffer**: to do this, you may need to dilute **20X TE Buffer** 20-fold with **nuclease-free water**. We do also have 1X TE BUffer available in the cabinet above the Centrifuge Workstation; there may also be pre-prepared 1X TE Buffer in the Underbench Fridge.

    -   Done prior to starting.

        -   2\. Prepare Working Solution: Dilute the **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** 1:400 in **1X TE buffer**, and mix. Working Solution may be available in the Underbench Fridge.

            -   Done prior to starting.

            -   Ran out of Working solution at 11th tube, ELP and JRE made \~1ml (3 parts dye to 1,197 TEx1) Working solution following protocol at 5:34.

                3\. Prepare Blank sample: Mix 2 Œºl of **1X TE buffer** with 200 Œºl of **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** Working Solution in an empty **0.5 ml PCR tube**. **Vortex** well and protect tube from light (we do this by covering the tube with aluminum foil).

            -   JRE pipetted 2 micro l of 1X TE buffer into 0.5ml tube at 5:10

            -   ELP pipetted 200 micro l of Working solution at 5:24.

                4\. Prepare Standard: Add 2 Œºl of the provided **DNA Standard** (100 ng/Œºl) to 200 Œºl of **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** working solution in an empty **0.5 ml PCR tube**. **Vortex** well and protect tube from light.

            -   JRE pipetted 2 microl l of DNA Standard into 0.5 tube at 5:11

            -   ELP pipetted 200 micro l of Working solution at 5:25.

                5\. Prepare Samples to be quantified: Add 1 or 2 Œºl of unknown samples to 200 Œºl of **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** working solution in **0.5 ml PCR tubes**. **Vortex** well, and protect tube from light. You will want to pipet the sample up and down multiple times to make sure the sample is well-blended.

            -   JRE pipetted 2 micro l from samples CL, 01, 02, 03, 04. Completed at 5:16.

            -   ELP pipetted 200 micro l of Working solution to samples CL, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05. Completed at 5:28.

            -   Completed (after remaking \~1ml Working solution) at 5:44.

                6\. Incubate the prepared samples at room temperature for 5 minutes, protected from light.

            -   Finished incubating at 5:49.

                7\. Select the dsDNA protocol on the **Quantus Fluorometer**.

            -   Completed by ELP at 5:45.

                8\. Prior to running samples on the Quantus Fluorometer, you should blend them well by **vortexing** briefly and then spinning them down briefly using the **microcentrifuge**. You should also wipe down the sides of the tubes with **kimwipes** to make sure the sides are clear from smudges.¬†

            -   ELP vortexed and centrifuged each sample.

                9\. If needed (you will need it!), calibrate the **Quantus Fluorometer** by reading the blank (Step 3; this should read as 0 ng/Œºl) and standard (Step 4; this should read as 100 ng/Œºl) samples in the Calibration screen, then select "Save".¬†

                -   **Note**: a few ng/Œºl away from what it should be is ok... but large deviations need to be troubleshooted!

            -   Calibration complete at 5:54.

                10\. Enter the volume of the unknown sample (1--2 Œºl used in Step 5) and desired concentration units (in our case, ng/Œºl).

            -   Already set prior to starting

                11\. Pipette to mix each sample at least 10 times before putting the desired amount in the working solution.¬†

            -   Done

                12\. One sample at a time, mix by vortexing, briefly spin down and wipe the outside of the tube with a kimwipe. Measure fluorescence of the unknown sample and record the final sample concentration results.

            <!-- -->

            -   **Note**: DNA yield is typically 15--60 ùúág but, depending on the individual stool sample and the way it was stored, may range from 5 to 100 ùúág. DNA concentration is typically 75--300 ng/ùúál
                -   Blank concentration: 0

    -   ELP removed spin columns from 1.5 ml tubes and put them in lid-less 2 ml tubes. Completed at 8:58.

40. The liquid in the tube contains the DNA from the samples and should be stored in the [-20 ¬∞C freezer]{style="color:green"} when not in use! (Be sure to record where in the freezer you've placed them, and make sure that they are all together in a single, clearly labeled container/rack)

    -   ELP and JRE placed spin columns and 1.5 ml tubes in freezer at 9:01.

41. The next step is to quantify the DNA in the samples (this is done by measuring the dsDNA concentration using the [Quantus]{style="color:green"} and the sample A260/A280 using the [Nanodrop]{style="color:green"}, both are located at the **Extraction Workstation**). The results should be recorded in your lab notebook

    -   **Note**: DNA yield is typically 15--60 ùúág but, depending on the individual stool sample and the way it was stored, may range from 5 to 100 ùúág. DNA concentration is typically 75--300 ng/ùúál

-   ELP cleaned the BSC with ethanol, water, and bleach at 8:30.

## March 8, 2024

-   1\. If necessary, prepare **1X TE Buffer**: to do this, you may need to dilute **20X TE Buffer** 20-fold with **nuclease-free water**. We do also have 1X TE BUffer available in the cabinet above the Centrifuge Workstation; there may also be pre-prepared 1X TE Buffer in the Underbench Fridge.

-   JRE made and aliquotted 1X TE Buffer at 12:14.

    -   2\. Prepare Working Solution: Dilute the **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** 1:400 in **1X TE buffer**, and mix. Working Solution may be available in the Underbench Fridge.

        -   ELP and JRE made 3.6 ml (3 parts dye to 1,197 TEx1 three times) Working solution following protocol at 12:23.

        -   JRE vortexed working solution at 12:31.

        -   JRE added 200 micro l of working solution into 14 autoclaved 0.5 ml tubes. Completed at 12:36.

            3\. Prepare Blank sample: Mix 2 Œºl of **1X TE buffer** with 200 Œºl of **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** Working Solution in an empty **0.5 ml PCR tube**. **Vortex** well and protect tube from light (we do this by covering the tube with aluminum foil).

        -   ELP pipetted 2 micro l of 1X TE buffer into 0.5ml tube at 12:37

            4\. Prepare Standard: Add 2 Œºl of the provided **DNA Standard** (100 ng/Œºl) to 200 Œºl of **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** working solution in an empty **0.5 ml PCR tube**. **Vortex** well and protect tube from light.

        -   ELP pipetted 2 microl l of DNA Standard into 0.5 tube at 12:39

            5\. Prepare Samples to be quantified: Add 1 or 2 Œºl of unknown samples to 200 Œºl of **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** working solution in **0.5 ml PCR tubes**. **Vortex** well, and protect tube from light. You will want to pipet the sample up and down multiple times to make sure the sample is well-blended.

        -   Completed by ELP at .

            8\. Prior to running samples on the Quantus Fluorometer, you should blend them well by **vortexing** briefly and then spinning them down briefly using the **microcentrifuge**. You should also wipe down the sides of the tubes with **kimwipes** to make sure the sides are clear from smudges.¬†

        -   ELP vortexed and centrifuged each sample 2 at a time while JRE placed in Quantus.

            9\. If needed (you will need it!), calibrate the **Quantus Fluorometer** by reading the blank (Step 3; this should read as 0 ng/Œºl) and standard (Step 4; this should read as 100 ng/Œºl) samples in the Calibration screen, then select "Save".¬†

            -   **Note**: a few ng/Œºl away from what it should be is ok... but large deviations need to be troubleshooted!

# Mar 25 - Mar 31

## March 28, 2024 (Post AABA re-quantitating)

-   1\. If necessary, prepare **1X TE Buffer**: to do this, you may need to dilute **20X TE Buffer** 20-fold with **nuclease-free water**. We do also have 1X TE BUffer available in the cabinet above the Centrifuge Workstation; there may also be pre-prepared 1X TE Buffer in the Underbench Fridge.

-   JRE mixed 10% bleach at 4:30, ethanol water bleach wiped.

-   JRE and ELP made and aliquotted 1X TE Buffer at 4:40.

    -   2\. Prepare Working Solution: Dilute the **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** 1:400 in **1X TE buffer**, and mix. Working Solution may be available in the Underbench Fridge.

        -   ELP and JRE made 1.2 ml (3 parts dye to 1,197 TEx1 three times) Working solution following protocol at 12:23.

        -   JRE vortexed working solution at 12:31.

        -   JRE added 200 micro l of working solution into 14 autoclaved 0.5 ml tubes. Completed at 5:18.

            3\. Prepare Blank sample: Mix 2 Œºl of **1X TE buffer** with 200 Œºl of **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** Working Solution in an empty **0.5 ml PCR tube**. **Vortex** well and protect tube from light (we do this by covering the tube with aluminum foil).

        -   ELP pipetted 2 micro l of 1X TE buffer into 0.5ml tube at 5:10

            4\. Prepare Standard: Add 2 Œºl of the provided **DNA Standard** (100 ng/Œºl) to 200 Œºl of **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** working solution in an empty **0.5 ml PCR tube**. **Vortex** well and protect tube from light.

        -   ELP pipetted 2 microl l of DNA Standard into 0.5 tube at 5:10

            5\. Prepare Samples to be quantified: Add 1 or 2 Œºl of unknown samples to 200 Œºl of **QuantiFluor¬Æ dsDNA Dye** working solution in **0.5 ml PCR tubes**. **Vortex** well, and protect tube from light. You will want to pipet the sample up and down multiple times to make sure the sample is well-blended.

        -   JRE pipetted 2 micro l from all samples. Completed at 5:10.

            6\. Incubate the prepared samples at room temperature for 5 minutes, protected from light.

        -   Finished incubating at 5:24.

        -   Repipetted into smaller tubes starting at 5:25, ended at 5:35.

            7\. Select the dsDNA protocol on the **Quantus Fluorometer**.

        -   Completed by JRE and ELP at 5:35.

            8\. Prior to running samples on the Quantus Fluorometer, you should blend them well by **vortexing** briefly and then spinning them down briefly using the **microcentrifuge**. You should also wipe down the sides of the tubes with **kimwipes** to make sure the sides are clear from smudges.¬†

        -   ELP vortexed and centrifuged each sample 2 at a time while JRE placed in Quantus.

            9\. If needed (you will need it!), calibrate the **Quantus Fluorometer** by reading the blank (Step 3; this should read as 0 ng/Œºl) and standard (Step 4; this should read as 100 ng/Œºl) samples in the Calibration screen, then select "Save".¬†

            -   **Note**: a few ng/Œºl away from what it should be is ok... but large deviations need to be troubleshooted!

        -   Calibration complete at 5:36.

            10\. Enter the volume of the unknown sample (1--2 Œºl used in Step 5) and desired concentration units (in our case, ng/Œºl).

        -   Already set prior to starting

            11\. Pipette to mix each sample at least 10 times before putting the desired amount in the working solution.¬†

        -   Done

            12\. One sample at a time, mix by vortexing, briefly spin down and wipe the outside of the tube with a kimwipe. Measure fluorescence of the unknown sample and record the final sample concentration results.

            BL read as: Lower than contol

            Standard read as: 100 ng/uL

    1.  Clean pedestal w kimwipes and nuclease free water
        -   ELP completed at 1:06.
    2.  Blank w 2 micro l of nuclease free water or storage medium (Buffer ATE)
        -   ELP blanked with Buffer ATE. Completed at 1:07
    3.  Between each sample, clean w kim wipe and nuclease free water
    4.  2 micro l of sample for each run

REDOING original quantitation!
